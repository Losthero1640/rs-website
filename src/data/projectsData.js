PID controllers have a wide range of applications starting from cruise control in cars to thermostats and to that of guided missiles. This setup can help one understand the basics of a PID controller.',

      'Low-cost 3D printer with thermal enclosure for high-precision, smooth, and faster prints.',
    longDescription: `Presenting our Low cost 3D Printer with thermal
enclosure, capable of printing with 75-micron
accuracy, achieving much faster printing and
precision than other printers. The enclosure
enables us to maintain a uniformly regulated
temperature and less moisture during the print,
comparatively providing a better finish at similar
accuracy.
We are grateful to our Alumni Bighnaraj Panigrahi
and Kamalesh Bharadwaj Mishra who supported
us for building this 3D printer enclosure and keep
on constantly supporting and motivating us.
Behold the progress of superior grade 3D print
developed at our 3D printer (Odisha's First Student made Low Cost 3D
Printer).`,
